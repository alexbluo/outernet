## Lightning Talk

**Some quick reminders:**

* 3-5 minutes
* Can be done with slides or no slides (we'd love to see you try!)
* You will have access to a projecter and/or a whiteboard
* if you need any props, please let us know!

### Plan

> What do you want to have your lightning talk about? It can be about anything like art to why JSX is bad, as long it's appropriate.
* Pretty self explanatory from above and below

> What would the talk look like? Mention if you're going to have slides!!
* Short introduction of myself and my experiences
* Go through the process of securing a sponsorship start to finish
* Cite past experiences for reference
* Touch on advice for first-time/underresourced hackathons
* Answer questions?
* I'll have slides and need a projector
* This will be the same talk I give at MLH HackCon
